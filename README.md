Project Description:

  For over a year and a half, the Gaza Strip has endured an unprecedented humanitarian disaster due to the ongoing siege, systematic targeting of civilian infrastructure, and repeated military escalations. Among the most severely affected sectors is healthcare, particularly for cancer patients, whose access to life-saving treatment has been critically disrupted.
  In November 2023, the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital—the only specialized cancer treatment facility in Gaza—was bombed and rendered non-functional. Since then, cancer patients have been left without access to essential therapies. Currently, five cancer patients die every day outside hospitals, due to the unavailability of medications and sudden evacuation orders that prevent continued care.
  These dire circumstances urgently call for a smart system to monitor the availability and distribution of cancer medications, track patient needs, ensure the optimal use of limited resources, and issue alerts when medication levels fall below critical thresholds.



Project Goals:

  The main purpose of this solution is to provide stakeholders with timely, actionable data to support decision-making in the challenging healthcare environment of the Gaza Strip, specifically for the vulnerable population of cancer patients.
  -	Integration and processing of cancer medication stock data by importing official updates from the Ministry of Health.
  -	Visualization of medication availability changes and patient needs through an interactive web dashboard, including color-coded indicators to highlight critical shortages and supply changes.
  -	Generation of detailed reports and statistical graphs, with support for custom filters such as medication type, location, and urgency level. This information will be made publicly accessible to interested organizations, healthcare providers, and academic researchers	.


Target Users:

  The primary users of this system are envisioned to be:
  -	Ministry of Health (Gaza): The specified employees in Public Relations and Media Department. The main role of this sector is
    * Regularly update the system with the number of new cancer patients and the cases that no longer require treatment for any reason
    * Enter the quantities of cancer medications arriving in the Gaza Strip and specify their sources.
  -	International Aid Organizations and NGOs: Involved in providing medical aid to Gaza, to understand the specific needs for cancer treatments and coordinate their support effectively.
